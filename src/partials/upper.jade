    | Everyone develops an opinion concerning the nature and disposition of tourists and fellow-travelers, whether it has been acquired through their own experiences or through second-hand accounts. We come to a partially-informed perspective as to who are the most grumpy or good-natured, usually according to where they call home.

    | RewardExpert set out to answer the question: which state’s residents are the grumpiest when traveling? RewardExpert took a look at the hard data to come up with a definitive and objective ranking. This ranking relies on hotel reviews that include both the reviewer’s location and a numerical rating.

      | Our analysis is based on 
      span.semibold
        | a set of 878,561 user reviews of a total of 4,333 hotels 
      | in the United States. We ranked states by three key metrics:

    ul.metrics__list
      li.metrics__list-item
        | the number of one- and two-star reviews proportional to population;

      li.metrics__list-item
        | the number of one- and two-star reviews as a proportion of all reviews from that state in our data set;

      li.metrics__list-item
        | the overall average rating for all reviews by users from that state.

    p.main-text
      span.semibold
        | We then combined these three into composite scores for grumpiness and happiness.
