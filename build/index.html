Tourists who call New Jersey home are among the most content, with the third lowest rate of negative hotel reviews in our data set, nearly 3% below the national average of 12.64% at 9.75%, and an average rating that ranks in the top ten, nationwide.</p></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><span class="rate-block">88.657</span><h3 class="rankings__item-title">Wisconsin</h3></div><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">9</p></div><p class="rankings__item-text">Coming in at number nine is the state of Wisconsin.
