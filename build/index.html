While its license plates may read “taxation without representation,” D.C. is the most over-represented in our set of negative hotel reviews, with 882 more than we estimated based on its 0.2% share of the US population.

At this point, a common thread has emerged: seven of the top eight states with the orneriest tourists have recently legalized recreational cannabis use.
